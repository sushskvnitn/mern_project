      functions that have access to the request object (req),
      the response object (res), and the next function in the application's

      The next function is a function in the Express router which, when invoked,
      executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware.


 ## connection to database :
          create a new clustor on mongo db atlas and then copy the config link there then 
           require mongoose in your app and after requiring  mongoose do following :: 
           (here DB is the connection link with username and passwords)

           mongoose
           .connect(DB, {
             useNewURLParser: true,
             useUnifiedTopology: true,
           }) //after connection we get a response 
           .then(() => {
             console.log("connection established to mongo");
           })
           .catch((err) => {
             console.log("no connection established to mongo");
           });


 ## dotenv:this npm package is used to secure your passwords and data , create a dotenv folder by

         that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued.
         verification through entire application after login is done bye jwt token
         * methods: *
          1: Generate JWT Token and Stored it in Database.
          2: How to Stored the Token in Cookies
          3: Get Token from Cookie and Verify the User

        jwt.sign(payload, secret OrPrivate Key, [options, callback])
